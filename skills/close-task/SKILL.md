description: Step-10 lifecycle closer. Three variants — Full lifecycle close (spec + alpha test + report done, human-validated at Step 9), Research / non-lifecycle close (investigation, spike, governance/docs — no spec, no alpha test, no forced ticket Done), and Transitory close (multi-session boundary — snapshot + memory only). Refreshes the context snapshot and TODO, appends to the chronicle on a decision of record, conditionally re-audits architecture from live sources, writes distilled MCP memory, rebuilds the INDEX, and moves the ticket to Done. Tracker-parameterized (Jira | Linear | none, read from .claude/settings.json). Honors protected (proposed for human authorization) and append-only doc rules.

# Close Task

Close a work session cleanly. Run after the human validates a lifecycle task at **Step 9**, or after a
non-lifecycle work session (investigation, spike, governance/docs). The **PM** runs this — it is the only role that
closes. There is no shortcut past the close: a session that produced work is not done until it is closed.

This skill is **plugin-resident** and **stack-/tracker-neutral**. It reads everything it needs at runtime — never
assume a stack, tracker, table, or path. Read these first, then act:

- **`.claude/settings.json`** — `tracker` (`jira | linear | none`) and its connection identity, `stack`
  (`web | data | generic`), enabled MCP servers, `separation_of_duties_mode`.
- **`corpus.config.mjs`** — per-project paths, ticket prefix, project slug, the corpus script names.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — model policy, lifecycle numbering, role roster, communication language, protected-doc list.
- **`.claude/rules/*.md`** — especially `frontmatter.md` (the taxonomy SSOT) and `mcp-usage.md` (the Memory protocol).

If the tracker is not declared in `settings.json`, ask the PM which variant of close to run before writing anything.

## 0. Pick the variant FIRST

The variant decides which sections run. Choose before touching any file.

| Variant | When | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Full lifecycle close** | A 10-step task is done — spec + alpha test + report exist, the human validated at Step 9 (or a sanctioned shortcut applies) | §1 (lifecycle read) + §2 + §3 + §4 + §5 |
| **Research / non-lifecycle close** | Investigation, spike, or governance/docs work — no spec, no alpha test, maybe no ticket | §1 (research read) + §2 + §4 + §5. **SKIP §3** (no spec flip/archive, no alpha test, no forced ticket Done) |
| **Transitory close** | A multi-session task at a session boundary — it continues next session | ONLY: overwrite `docs/context_snapshot.md` + write MCP memory + `/log-activity paused`. **No** chronicle, **no** ticket Done, the spec stays `in_progress` |

A multi-session lifecycle task gets a **transitory close at each boundary** and **exactly one full close at the end**.

## 1. Read context

Read what the session actually produced before writing anything.

- **Full:** the latest report in `docs/claude_tasks/reports/`; the spec (`docs/claude_tasks/<NN_slug>.md`) for its
  acceptance criteria and its tracker id; the alpha-test result in `docs/claude_tasks/alpha_tests/`;
  `git diff --stat <default-branch>` (resolve the default branch — do not hardcode `main`); `TODO.md`.
- **Research:** the artifact(s) the session produced (the `docs/research/` doc, knowledge-base or schema files,
  governance edits); `git diff --stat <default-branch>`; `TODO.md` and the tracking ticket if one exists.
- **Transitory:** the in-flight spec and report draft; the current branch state. Read only enough to write an
  accurate snapshot.

## 2. Universal updates (Full + Research)

### Artifact placement (tidy first)
Confirm every file the session produced is in its canonical folder per the repository's doc-structure guide
(research → dated `docs/research/`; domain knowledge → `docs/knowledge_base/`; schema → `docs/schema/` if the stack
uses one; lifecycle artifacts under `docs/claude_tasks/`), each with valid frontmatter. Nothing orphaned at the
`docs/` root. A tidy tree is the precondition for a trustworthy index.

### project_chronicle.md — APPEND-ONLY, CONDITIONAL
`docs/project_chronicle.md` is **append-only**: add a new dated entry, **never** edit or delete a prior one.
Append **ONLY IF a decision of record or a change of project direction was made**. Routine task completion and
research extracts do **not** earn a chronicle entry — a research doc's home is `docs/research/`. When in doubt,
the chronicle records *why the project changed direction*, not *what was done this session*.

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — {decision / direction title}
**Context:** {what prompted it}
**Decision of record:** {what was decided; also recorded in strategy.md if a formal decision}
**Cited evidence:** {file:line, data finding, council doc, or prior chronicle entry}
**Status:** Decision of record
```

### context_snapshot.md — OVERWRITE
Overwrite `docs/context_snapshot.md` (the single where-we-are handoff; usually gitignored). The deliberate overwrite
keeps it a snapshot, not a log. Current state only, facts only, kept short:
- What was just completed this session.
- What is next (mirror the top of `TODO.md`).
- Blockers / open questions.
- Current state of any open decisions and the deploy/pipeline status if the stack has one.

### MCP Memory — distilled knowledge only
Use the `memory` MCP server (per-project knowledge graph; path is configured per-project — never shared). Persist
**what future sessions need to know**, not raw activity. Follow `.claude/rules/mcp-usage.md`.

**Persist:** schema surprises (unexpected types, nullability, format quirks); platform gotchas (whatever the
project's runtime quirks are); data patterns (cardinality anomalies, NULL rates, cross-source inconsistencies);
decisions that change how future work is done; baseline counts that serve as anchors (row counts, match rates,
component counts).

**Do NOT persist:** routine progress (already in the activity log / tracker); anything already in a report; anything
derivable from code or `git log`; secrets, tokens, hostnames, or infrastructure identifiers.

**Operations:** `add_observations` (new facts on existing entities), `create_entities` (new concepts — tables,
patterns, quirks), `create_relations` (links between entities). The activity log is the audit trail; MCP memory is
distilled knowledge — keep them distinct.

### Index rebuild — unconditional when frontmatter changed
If any frontmatter changed this session, rebuild the corpus index by running the project's build-index script
(its name is in `corpus.config.mjs` — typically `node scripts/build-index.mjs`). If
`git diff --quiet docs/INDEX.md docs/index.json` reports dirty, stage both and include them in the close commit.
Make this **unconditional on frontmatter change** — a conditional rebuild leaves an intra-day drift window, and the
pre-push hook / CI will block the push if the INDEX drifts from source.

### Activity log
Write the closing line via `/log-activity <variant>-closed: <summary>` (the cheap, tracker-free half of the
dual-write). A **Full lifecycle close** is a milestone, so additionally route it through `/log-tracker`
(step 10, agent `pm`) so the tracker gets the closing comment cross-referenced by id. Skip `/log-tracker` when
`tracker = none`.

## 3. Lifecycle-only updates (FULL close only — skip in Research and Transitory)

### Spec frontmatter
On the closing spec (`docs/claude_tasks/<NN_slug>.md`): set `status: done`, bump `updated:` to today's ISO date, and
append **unambiguous** `affects:` items only (table names, route paths, migration ids, RPC names that the work
actually touched — confirm against the diff; never invent). Follow the enums in `.claude/rules/frontmatter.md`.

### Spec archive
Move the spec into the archive: `git mv docs/claude_tasks/<NN_slug>.md docs/claude_tasks/archive/<NN_slug>.md`.
The frontmatter keeps `type: spec` + `status: done` (an explicit declaration wins over any archive-path heuristic).

### Tracker — branch on the configured tracker

Read `tracker` from `.claude/settings.json`. Run exactly one branch.

#### If `tracker = linear`
Use the Linear MCP (`mcp__*__Linear__*`). The workspace/team/project identity is in `settings.json` /
`corpus.config.mjs` — read it, do not hardcode.

1. **Append Completion Notes** to the issue description (append, never replace):
   ```
   ## Completion Notes
   - **Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Implemented by:** {de / da / pm}
   - **Files modified:** {list}
   - **Key decisions:** {any deviations from the spec}
   - **Alpha test:** docs/claude_tasks/alpha_tests/<NN_slug>.md — passed / failed / N/A
   - **Task report:** docs/claude_tasks/reports/YYYY-MM-DD_<NN_slug>_report.md
   - **Commit:** `git log -1 --oneline` (or "No commit — analysis only")
   ```
2. **Move the issue to Done** — `save_issue` with `state: "Done"`.
3. **New work discovered** → create sub-issues (labels, dependencies, dates). Post-seal alpha-test edge cases land
   here as new tickets — **never** as retroactive mutation of the sealed test.
4. **Parent has all sub-issues Done** → move the parent to Done too.

#### If `tracker = jira`
Use the Atlassian MCP (`mcp__*__Atlassian__*`). Read the `cloud id` / site and project key from `settings.json` /
`corpus.config.mjs`. Resolve the issue key from the spec's tracker id.

1. **Append Completion Notes** to the issue description via `editJiraIssue` (fetch the current description with
   `getJiraIssue`, append the block below, write it back — do not overwrite prior content):
   ```
   h2. Completion Notes
   * *Completed:* YYYY-MM-DD
   * *Implemented by:* {de / da / pm}
   * *Files modified:* {list}
   * *Key decisions:* {any deviations from the spec}
   * *Alpha test:* docs/claude_tasks/alpha_tests/<NN_slug>.md — passed / failed / N/A
   * *Task report:* docs/claude_tasks/reports/YYYY-MM-DD_<NN_slug>_report.md
   * *Commit:* git short hash + message (or "No commit — analysis only")
   ```
   (Also acceptable: post the block as a comment via `addCommentToJiraIssue` if the project convention is
   comment-based completion notes — follow `corpus.config.mjs`.)
2. **Transition the issue to Done** — call `getTransitionsForJiraIssue` to find the transition id whose target is the
   Done status (the name varies per workflow: "Done", "Closed", "Resolved"), then `transitionJiraIssue` with that id.
   Never guess the transition id.
3. **New work discovered** → `createJiraIssue` under the same project/epic (set issue type, labels, links via
   `createIssueLink`). Post-seal alpha-test edge cases become new issues, never test mutation.
4. **Parent epic has all child issues Done** → transition the epic to Done as well.

#### If `tracker = none`
No tracker calls. The Completion Notes live only in `TODO.md` and the chronicle/report. Proceed.

### TODO.md — PROTECTED, STATUS-SYNC ONLY
`TODO.md` is **protected**: close-task is the **only** sanctioned agent write path. Flip status markers, add
completion dates, and unblock downstream rows that this task gated. **Never** add, remove, reword, or reprioritize
tickets — that content is the human's. Follow the file's own rewrite pattern (full rewrite, not a patch, if its
header specifies one).

## 4. Conditionally update (Full + Research — only if the thing actually changed)

Evaluate what changed; do **NOT** touch a file if nothing relevant changed. Two non-negotiable rules govern this
section: **one fact, one place** (no duplication across docs) and **re-audit live sources, never write from
memory**. **Protected files are PROPOSED for human authorization — never edited unilaterally.** Present the proposed
diff in chat and wait for the human's approval before applying it.

| Target | Update ONLY IF | How / protection |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | the live system changed: schema (new/dropped tables, policy/migration/RPC/trigger/extension changes), routes/API surface, ETL or sync workflows, auth/session model, tech stack (package add/remove/major-bump), deploy topology. Single bug fixes do **not** count. | **PROTECTED.** Re-audit live sources before writing — never from memory (see §4.1). Propose the diff; the human authorizes. Update the `Audited:` date line and the snapshot counts. May not exist yet → skip and note. |
| `docs/strategy.md` | a decision of record was made (new threshold, new approach, design change) | **PROTECTED.** Lands in the Decision Log. A `/council` verdict counts as approval for its own entry. Propose; human authorizes. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | a governance-level reference changed (new skill, new convention, a TBD resolved) | **PROTECTED.** Propose the diff; wait for approval. |
| repository doc-structure guide | the repo structure, folders, or an update protocol changed | PM-maintained SSOT; flag structural changes to the human. |
| `docs/knowledge_base/` | agent-grounding content changed (glossary, data dictionary, business rules) | Per the repo guide; apply a confidentiality gate before any content leaves an internal/private boundary. |
| `docs/schema/` (data stack only) | the data layer changed (gold tables, semantic model) | Re-audit the live source; keep the directory split the project defines. |
| `README.md` | the repo-visitor-visible status changed (phase transition, major capability landed) | Normal doc. |

### 4.1 Re-auditing `docs/architecture.md` (the protocol)
When the trigger matrix above fires, **re-audit from live sources** — do not recall. Use whatever the project's
stack provides (read `stack` from `settings.json`):
- **Schema** → the stack's live introspection (e.g. `list_tables` / `list_migrations` / catalog queries via the
  configured data MCP, or the data warehouse's information-schema). Read it; do not remember it.
- **Routes / API surface** → glob the project's route files (the patterns are stack-specific — discover them from
  the repo, do not assume a framework).
- **ETL / sync schedules** → read the workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml` or the scheduler config).
- **Tech stack** → `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / the lockfile — no exceptions, never from memory.
- **Deploy topology** → the deploy config file + the deploy provider's MCP if one is configured.

Because `architecture.md` is **protected**, the output of the re-audit is a **proposed diff** presented to the human
for authorization — the PM does not write it unilaterally.

## 5. Commit and report

### Commit (Full close)
Stage the index files, the archived/updated spec, and any authorized doc edits, then commit on the task branch
(`1 ticket = 1 branch = 1 PR`; never force-push; never commit to the default branch directly). Let the post-commit
hook append the `committed` activity-log line.

### Report
State the variant and what was updated vs skipped. Examples:

**Full lifecycle close (tracker = jira):**
```
Variant: Full lifecycle close
Updated: project_chronicle.md (decision of record), context_snapshot.md, TODO.md (status-sync), MCP memory, INDEX, spec (done + archived)
Conditionally updated: architecture.md (§schema — proposed diff for migration 0032 + RPC fix; AWAITING human authorization)
Tracker: Jira PROJ-142 → Completion Notes appended, transitioned to Done
Skipped: strategy.md (no decision of record beyond the one chronicled)
```

**Research / non-lifecycle close (tracker = linear):**
```
Variant: Research / non-lifecycle close
Updated: docs/research/2026-06-29_slug.md (placed + frontmatter), context_snapshot.md, MCP memory, INDEX
Conditionally updated: none (repository guide / schema / KB unchanged)
Chronicle: skipped (no decision of record)
Tracker: comment on PROJ-123 (no Done — investigation continues)
Skipped (lifecycle-only): spec flip/archive, alpha test, ticket Done
```

**Transitory close:**
```
Variant: Transitory close (session boundary)
Updated: context_snapshot.md (overwritten), MCP memory, activity log (paused)
Spec: stays in_progress. No chronicle, no tracker Done. Resume next session from the snapshot.
```
