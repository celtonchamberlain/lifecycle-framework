description: Corpus health check — validate all .md frontmatter, rebuild docs/INDEX.md + docs/index.json, and write a tiered health report to docs/audits/. Findings are tiered High/Medium/Low; High includes frontmatter parse errors, dangling refs, broken mandatory-read paths, and sealed alpha tests modified after sealing (the freeze-rule enforcement). Use weekly, after a batch of .md edits, or after a /close-task that changed frontmatter broadly. Triggers include "/audit-corpus", "audit the corpus", "rebuild the index", "check frontmatter".

# audit-corpus

Full corpus health check for the governance corpus:

1. validate every governed `.md` frontmatter,
2. rebuild the queryable index `docs/INDEX.md` + `docs/index.json`,
3. write a tiered **High / Medium / Low** health report to `docs/audits/`.

Run **weekly**, after any large batch of `.md` edits, or after a `/close-task` that changed frontmatter broadly.

> **Scripts (project-scaffolded — invoked by repo-relative path, never `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`):**
> `scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs` + `scripts/build-index.mjs`
> **Output:** Console summary + `docs/INDEX.md` + `docs/index.json` + `docs/audits/<YYYY-WW>_health_audit.md`

The corpus engine lives in the **project repo** (`scripts/*.mjs` + `corpus.config.mjs`), not in the plugin, because the same scripts are called by git hooks and CI by relative path. Always call them with the repo-relative path shown below.

## Trigger

- `/audit-corpus`
- "audit the corpus" / "rebuild the index" / "check frontmatter" / "audita el corpus"

---

## Steps

1. **Run validation** across all governed docs:
   ```
   node scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs docs .claude
   ```
   - Hard violations are listed with a `[HARD]` prefix; soft warnings with `[WARN]`.
   - Exit 0 = clean; exit 1 = hard violations present.

2. **Run the health checks** (these go beyond the validator — execute them explicitly):

   - **Dangling refs:** every `depends_on:` / `affects:` / `supersedes:` value must resolve to an existing file (or, where the schema allows it, to a known ticket id). An unresolved reference is a High finding.
   - **Sealed alpha-test integrity (the FREEZE RULE):** for every file in `docs/claude_tasks/alpha_tests/` whose `status:` is `sealed`, `passed`, or `failed`, compare the date of the last commit touching the file against its `sealed_date`:
     ```
     git log -1 --format=%cs -- <file>
     ```
     A modification dated **after** `sealed_date` that is **not** a sanctioned status transition (`sealed` → `passed`/`failed` at lifecycle Step 8) is a **High** finding — the alpha test was edited after it was frozen, which defeats the bias-free verdict. Report the file, the `sealed_date`, and the offending commit date.
   - **Mandatory-read paths:** every file referenced by the session-start protocol in the project root `CLAUDE.md` must exist. Treat a path that `CLAUDE.md` itself marks as expected-absent (e.g. `docs/architecture.md` before it is first authored) as not-a-finding.
   - **Staleness:** `updated:` older than 60 days on docs with `status: active | living | in_progress`.
   - **Orphan specs:** a spec with `status: done` and no matching report in `docs/claude_tasks/reports/` nor any review in `docs/claude_tasks/reviews/` for its `task_number`.
   - **Activity silence:** a spec with `status: in_progress` and no line for its ticket / `task_number` in `docs/activity_log.jsonl` within the last 14 days (ignore `session: "backfill"` lines).
   - **`task_number` collisions:** two specs — or two alpha tests — sharing the same `NN`.

3. **Triage findings by severity:**

   | Tier | Findings | Action |
   |------|----------|--------|
   | **High** | Frontmatter parse errors · missing required fields · dangling `depends_on:`/`affects:`/`supersedes:` refs · **sealed alpha test modified after `sealed_date`** · broken mandatory-read paths | **Block:** fix before committing the index. Sealed-test violations escalate to the human — never silently "fix" the test (see Hard rules). |
   | **Medium** | Stale `updated:` (>60d on active docs) · orphan specs (no report/review chain) · spec `in_progress` with no activity-log line in 14d | Report + propose fixes; apply only the mechanical ones (a date bump requires the doc to actually be re-verified, not blind-bumped). |
   | **Low** | Empty `tags: []` · `task_number` collisions | Report; fix opportunistically. |

   For files needing human judgment (wrong `type`, wrong `status`, ambiguous `authority`): present them to the user for a decision — do not guess.

4. **Rebuild the index** (after High findings are cleared, or standalone if the corpus is already clean):
   ```
   node scripts/build-index.mjs
   ```
   - Outputs `docs/INDEX.md` and `docs/index.json` — **never hand-edit these.**
   - Reports: files indexed, sections, elapsed time. The script enforces a <5s performance gate and exits non-zero if it is breached.

5. **Write the health report** to `docs/audits/<YYYY-WW>_health_audit.md` (ISO week, e.g. `2026-24_health_audit.md`), with frontmatter `type: audit`, `status: snapshot`, `authority: secondary`. Contents:
   - Total files checked, broken down by `type`.
   - High / Medium / Low findings — each with its file path and the specific check that fired.
   - What was auto-fixed vs. what awaits a human decision.
   - Index rebuild stats (files indexed, elapsed time).
   - Delta vs. the previous week's audit (new findings, resolved findings).

6. **Commit** (only if **no High findings remain**):
   ```
   git add docs/INDEX.md docs/index.json docs/audits/
   git commit -m "docs: corpus audit <YYYY-WW> — index rebuilt, N findings"
   ```
   Use the project's commit convention from `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md`; if the project ties commits to a ticket prefix, read that prefix from `corpus.config.mjs` / `CLAUDE.md` rather than hardcoding one.

---

## Scheduled audit (optional)

If the project wants a recurring audit, register it once via the `/schedule` skill. Pick a fixed UTC cron; document the local-time equivalent (and any DST adjustment) in the schedule label rather than assuming a timezone here:

```
/schedule create --cron "0 13 * * *" --invoke "/audit-corpus" --commit-output --label "<project>-corpus-audit"
```

The drift window between scheduled runs is the cron interval; real-time freshness is already enforced by the pre-push git hook and the `lint-frontmatter` CI gate (both rebuild the INDEX and block on drift).

---

## Hard rules

- NEVER commit `docs/INDEX.md` or `docs/index.json` while **High** findings are unresolved — indexing broken frontmatter produces unreliable lookups.
- NEVER skip the validation step before rebuilding the index.
- NEVER modify a sealed alpha test to clear a High finding. The modification **is** the finding — escalate it to the human; do not edit the test to make the check pass.
- If `scripts/build-index.mjs` exceeds its 5s gate, flag it as a performance regression (the script exits non-zero on breach).
- The health report is a snapshot — never edit a previous week's report; always write a new dated file.
- Call the corpus scripts by their repo-relative path (`scripts/...`), never via the plugin root — git hooks and CI invoke the same scripts that way.
